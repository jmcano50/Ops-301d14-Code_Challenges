# Ops Challenge: Clearing Logs

**Overview**

Log clearing can be useful as an administrator of your logs are routinely rotated, or youâ€™re in a situation where the log file sizes are getting out of hand. Today, you will be writing a bash script that clears log files for you.

**Objectives**

Write a log clearing bash script.

**Tasks**

*Write a bash script that performs the following tasks:*

Print to the screen the file size of the log files before compression
Compress the contents of the log files listed below to a backup directory
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/wtmp
The file name should contain a time stamp with the following format -YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

Example: /var/log/backups/syslog-20220928081457.zip
Hint: gzip is a preinstalled Linux application for performing zip formatted compression.

Clear the contents of the log file
Print to screen the file size of the compressed file
Compare the size of the compressed files to the size of the original log files

**Stretch Goals**

In offensive security operations, often an attacker will want to use a log clearing script to remove the evidence of their behavior on the targeted computer systems. How can your script be used to clear tracks?
