# Ops Challenge: Python File Handling

**Overview**

- Today, you will be using Pythonâ€™s file handling capabilities to open and manipulate an existing file. This can be useful in generating log files or working with CSV or JSON data files.

**Objectives**

- Using file handling commands, create a Python script that creates a new .txt file, appends three lines, prints to the screen the first line, then deletes the .txt file.

**Stretch Goal**

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Export your pfSense configuration.
Have your Python script open the exported file.
Code up your script to change a value inside the file.
Save the changes out to a new file name.
Re-import the modified configuraiton file, to verify that your changes will be accepted by pfSense.
