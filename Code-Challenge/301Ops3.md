# Ops Challenge: File Permissions
## Overview
Linux sets file permissions by User, Group, and Other. Linux also sorts permission by Read, Write, and Execute. Today, you will be create a bash script that alters file permissions of everything in a directory.

## Objectives
Take care to only perform this operation in user-created directories. Changing permissions in system files/directories is not advised, as this can cause malfunctions in the OS.

Create a new bash script that performs the following:

- Prompts user for input directory path.
- Prompts user for input permissions number (e.g. 777 to perform a chmod 777)
- Navigates to the directory input by the user and changes all files inside it to the input setting.
- Prints to the screen the directory contents and the new permissions settings of everything in the directory.
## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Design your script to output a log file of all actions that were taken by the script.
- Design your script to output to the screen each file changed one by one, with a slight delay between each file changed.
