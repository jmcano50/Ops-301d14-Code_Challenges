# Ops Challenge: Bash in Python

**Overview**

Reputed in the cyber community for its various applications ranging from malware analysis to penetration testing, Python is one of the most in-demand and recommended coding languages to learn for a career in cyber security. Today, you will be executing a Linux terminal commands from within a Python script.

**Resources**

Python.org is a great encyclopedia of Python commands and will be a common reference as you practice this new language.

Refer to README.md for more helpful resources in learning Python.

**Objectives**

Before proceeding, ensure that course prework assignment “Setup Python” is complete.

Microsoft Visual Studio Code is the recommended IDE for Python assignments throughout the Ops sequence.

In Ubuntu, create a Python script that executes a few bash commands successfully. Indicate in comments how you achieved this.

**Requirements:**

The Python module “os” must be utilized.
At least three variables must be declared and referenced in Python.
The Python function print() must be used at least three times.
Include execution of the following bash commands inside your Python script:

whoami
ip a
lshw -short
Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

Instead of the os module, utilize the subprocess module instead. Refer to python.org for how this can be achieved.
