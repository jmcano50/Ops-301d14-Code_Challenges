# Ops Challenge: Python Collections

**Overview**

Python is known for its relevance to data science and consequently handles data quite well using array. A fundamental grasp of data structures and algorithms will help you a great deal in feeling comfortable with these concepts during an intense job interview for a position where you’ll be automating tedious processes for the company. Today, you will be working with lists in Python.

**Objectives**

Create a Python script that includes the following:

- Assign to a variable a list of ten string elements.

- Print the fourth element of the list.

- Print the sixth through tenth element of the list.

- Change the value of the seventh element to “onion”.

**Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)**

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

**Use the below Python methods once each against your list to manipulate the elements in your list:**
- append()
- clear()
- copy()
- count()
- extend()
- index()
- insert()
- pop()
- remove()
- reverse()
- sort()

Create one tuple. Create one set. Create one dictionary.
