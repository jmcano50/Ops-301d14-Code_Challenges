# Ops Challenge: Python Conditional Statements

**Overview**

Conditionals are an important tool in any language and see plenty of use in Python. The ability to influence a computer system’s decision making process based on value comparisons is powerful and an essential ingredient in most programming languages. Today, you will be using “if statements” in Python.

**Objectives**

Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a   >= b

Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.

Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.

**Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)**

- Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Create an if statement with two conditions by using and between conditions.

- Create an if statement with two conditions by using or between conditions.

- Create a nested if statement.

- Create an if statement that includes pass to avoid errors.
